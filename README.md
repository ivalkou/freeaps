# FreeAPS X

## Introduction 

FreeAPS X - an artificial pancreas system for iOS based on [OpenAPS Reference](https://github.com/openaps/oref0) algorithms

FreeAPS X uses original JavaScript files of oref0 and provides a user interface (UI) to control and set up the system. 

This repo includes two branchs allowing to use OmniPod Dash pumps : 
- the branch dash_dev includes the dash pump in the setting pump 
- the branch dash_garmin_disf_dev includes the dash pump, but also the dISF implementation (with update of openAPS) and the garmin service to connect with garmin watches. 

To use this branch : 

git clone -b dash_dev remote-repo-url or git clone -b dash_garmin_disf_dev remote-repo-url 

or use directly Xcode to use one specific branch. 

Don't forget to copy / reference your ConfigOverride

# Precaution 

Please understand that these version are :
- highly experimental
- not approved for therapy

WARNING 
- The settings of your current FAX should not be re-init when you update to this version but check it before close loop 
- The update MUST ONLY be done when you change of a pod. The previous pod would be not accessible. So, first, desactivate your current pod then compile and update your FAX on your phone and add a new pod with the dash pump menu.


These version were tested by few developers with success. But...Don't hesitate to create issues if you find bugs or issues.
