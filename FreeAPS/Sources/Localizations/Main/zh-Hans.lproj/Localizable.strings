/* ”Rewind Resets Autosens” */

If you usually rewind your pump independently of site changes, you may want to consider disabling this feature." = "该功能默认启用，当复位胰岛素泵时，Autosens参数会重置为中性，这基于复位胰岛素泵是您会更换管路部位的假设。Autosens将会在胰岛素泵复位后开始重新学习灵敏度，这可能需要6个小时。如果你通常复位泵时并没有同时更换部位，你可能要考虑禁用这一功能。";

/* ”High Temptarget Raises Sensitivity" */
"Defaults to false. When set to true, raises sensitivity (lower sensitivity ratio) for temp targets set to >= 111. Synonym for exercise_mode.

默认禁用。当设置为 \"true \"时，对设置为>=111的临时目标提高敏感系数（降低灵敏度比率）。与exercise_mode同义。你的临时目标越高于110，将导致更低的敏感系数，例如，临时目标为120，导致敏感系数为0.75，而140导致0.6（默认halfBasalTarget为160）。";

/* ”Low Temptarget Lowers Sensitivity" */

/* ”Advanced Target Adjustments" */
"This feature was previously enabled by default but will now default to false (will NOT be enabled automatically) in oref0 0.6.0 and beyond. (There is no need for this with 0.6.0). This feature lowers oref0’s target BG automatically when current BG and eventualBG are high. This helps prevent and mitigate high BG, but automatically switches to low-temping to ensure that BG comes down smoothly toward your actual target. If you find this behavior too aggressive, you can disable this feature. If you do so, please let us know so we can better understand what settings work best for everyone." = "这个功能以前是默认启用的，但现在在oref0 0.6.0及以后的版本中会默认为false(不会自动启用)。(0.6.0中没有必要这样做)。当当前BG和最终BG较高时，这个功能会自动降低oref0的目标BG。这有助于防止和缓解高BG，但会自动切换到低Temping，以确保BG平稳地朝你的实际目标下降。如果你觉得这种行为过于激进，你可以禁用这个功能。如果你这样做，请让我们知道，以便我们能够更好地了解什么设置对每个人都是最有效的。";

/* "Wide BG Target Range" */
"Defaults to false, which means by default only the low end of the pump’s BG target range is used as OpenAPS target. This is a safety feature to prevent too-wide targets and less-optimal outcomes. Therefore the higher end of the target range is used only for avoiding bolus wizard overcorrections. Use wide_bg_target_range: true to force neutral temps over a wider range of eventualBGs." = "默认禁用，这意味着默认情况下只有泵上设备的低血糖限制被用作OpenAPS目标。这是一个安全功能，以防止目标范围过宽和不理想的结果。因此，高的血糖目标范围仅用于大剂量向导的过度校正。使用 wide_bg_target_range: true使用适中的目标血糖来约束更宽的血糖控制目标。";

/* "Skip Neutral Temps" */
"Defaults to false, so that FreeAPS X will set temps whenever it can, so it will be easier to see if the system is working, even when you are offline. This means FreeAPS X will set a “neutral” temp (same as your default basal) if no adjustments are needed. This is an old setting for OpenAPS to have the options to minimise sounds and notifications from the 'rig', that may wake you up during the night." = "默认禁用，这样FreeAPS X就会在任何时候设置临时目标，这样就会更容易看到系统是否在工作，即使你不在线。这意味着如果不需要调整，OpenAPS将设置一个 \"中性 \"临时基础（与你的默认基础相同）。这是OpenAPS的一个旧设置，可以选择最大限度地减少 \"设备 \"的声音和通知，这些声音和通知可能会在夜间吵醒你。";

/* "Unsuspend If No Temp” */
"Many people occasionally forget to resume / unsuspend their pump after reconnecting it. If you’re one of them, and you are willing to reliably set a zero temp basal whenever suspending and disconnecting your pump, this feature has your back. If enabled, it will automatically resume / unsuspend the pump if you forget to do so before your zero temp expires. As long as the zero temp is still running, it will leave the pump suspended." = " 默认为false。在泵被暂停期间，任何现有的临时基础率将被删除，并以空的基础率来抵消配置基础率。";

/* "Enable UAM" */
"With this option enabled, the SMB algorithm can recognize unannounced meals. This is helpful, if you forget to tell FreeAPS X about your carbs or estimate your carbs wrong and the amount of entered carbs is wrong or if a meal with lots of fat and protein has a longer duration than expected. Without any carb entry, UAM can recognize fast glucose increasments caused by carbs, adrenaline, etc, and tries to adjust it with SMBs. This also works the opposite way: if there is a fast glucose decreasement, it can stop SMBs earlier." = "启用该选项后，SMB算法可以识别未宣布的膳食。这很有帮助，如果你忘记告诉FreeAPS X你的碳水化合物，或者估计错误，输入的碳水化合物的数量是错误的，或者如果一餐有大量脂肪和蛋白质的时间比预期的长。在没有任何碳水化合物输入的情况下，UAM可以识别由碳水化合物、肾上腺素等引起的快速葡萄糖增量，并尝试用SMB进行调整。这也有相反的作用：如果有快速的葡萄糖递减，它可以提前停止SMBs。";

/* "Max IOB" */
"Max IOB is the maximum amount of insulin on board from all sources – both basal (or SMB correction) and bolus insulin – that your loop is allowed to accumulate to treat higher-than-target BG. Unlike the other two OpenAPS safety settings (max_daily_safety_multiplier and current_basal_safety_multiplier), max_iob is set as a fixed number of units of insulin. As of now manual boluses are NOT limited by this setting. \n\n To test your basal rates during nighttime, you can modify the Max IOB setting to zero while in Closed Loop.
